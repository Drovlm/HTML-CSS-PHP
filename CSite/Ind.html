                The most important car lights are headlights. The two types of headlights are low beam and high beam, which allow drivers to see the road in the dark and make themselves visible to other motorists.
                Other car lights include DRLs, sidelights, and fog lights.

                    a suitable point of the vehicle away from its occupants.

                    <p>also known as winter tires, are tires designed for use on snow and ice. Snow tires have a tread design with larger
                        gaps than those on conventional tires, increasing traction on snow and ice. </p></div>

                        Compared to ice or snow tires, they lack studs but contain deeper and wider grooves meant to help the tread sink into mud or gravel surfaces.</p></div>

                    from a controlled combustion inside an engine or stove.
                    The entire system conveys burnt gases from the engine and includes one or more exhaust pipes.
                    Exhaust gases are collected from the cylinder head in the engine by an exhaust manifold.
                    The exhaust manifold acts as a funnel,
                    diverting exhaust gases from all cylinders of the engine then releases them through a single opening,
                    often referred to as the front pipe.</p>
